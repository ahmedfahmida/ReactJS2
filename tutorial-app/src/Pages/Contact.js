        <p>Narrated by Death, the story follows Liesel Meminger, a young girl living with foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, 
            in Nazi Germany during World War II. Liesel settles down into her new home and during her time there, she is exposed to 
            the horrors of the war and politics. As the political situation in Germany deteriorates, her foster parents conceal a Jewish 
            man named Max Vandenburg. Hans, who has developed a close relationship with Liesel, teaches her to read during this time. 
            Recognizing the power of writing and sharing the written word, Liesel not only begins to steal books that the politicians are 
            seeking to destroy, but also writes her own story, and shares the power of language with Max. By collecting laundry for her foster
             mother, she also begins a relationship with the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann, who allows her to read books in her library and steal
              them later.</p>
